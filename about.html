<h2>CoWeLearn</h2>
<p>The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has affected all including children. It has made a dreadful impact on child education, most notably of poor and deprived families. As per UNESCO estimates, education of 120 crore students across the world is disrupted by school closures.
    Quality education starts with us â€“ as a student, as a parent or as a teacher, we all get a say in how we educate the next generations and what tools we give them to build our future. And for that, we've built this amazing portal-CoWeLearn!
